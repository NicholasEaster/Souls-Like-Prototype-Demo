# Souls-Like-Prototype-Demo
Here is a demo for a Unreal Engine 5 souls like prototype. I cannot include the actual code since it does contain some marketplace assets and may be a licensing issue...

# How to run:
1. Open up the folder: Build_Demo
2. Double click the SunkenCity.exe file
3. Close the program at any time by pressing Esc

# Media Folder
The media folder contains some images and a video of the full environment that will be used. Unfortunatly I do not have the current environment prepared for gameplay, so for now it remains playable on the level.

# Credits:
While the vast majority of this project is self made, there are a few things
that aren't.

# Models:
The Knight model was made by: (Naked Singularity Studio - Fantasy)

online)
